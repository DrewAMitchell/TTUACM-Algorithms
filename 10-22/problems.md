**Write the knightDistance function for the below problem.**

If i and j are integers in {1..8}, let (i,j) represent the square on the chess board i squares from the left and j from the top (e.g., (1,1) is the upper left corner and (8,8) is the lower right). Now if s and e are valid squares on the board,  knightDistance(s, e) is the smallest number of moves a knight can take to get from s to e.

**Write a function called isRotation(s1, s2) that returns true if s2 is a rotation of s1, and false otherwise.**

Assuming that we have a method isSubstring, that returns true or false depending on whether or not string1 is a substring of string2, use isSubstring to determine whether or not string2 is a rotation of string1. For example, ‘erac’ is a rotation of ‘race’ and has been rotated once. ‘cera’ is a rotation of ‘race’ and has been rotated twice. ‘rcae’ is not a rotation of ‘race’.
