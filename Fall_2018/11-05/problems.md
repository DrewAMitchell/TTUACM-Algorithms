**Write the knightDistance function for the below problem.**

If i and j are integers in {1..8}, let (i,j) represent the square on the chess board i squares from the left and j from the top (e.g., (1,1) is the upper left corner and (8,8) is the lower right). Now if s and e are valid squares on the board,  knightDistance(s, e) is the smallest number of moves a knight can take to get from s to e.

**Implement the FindPairWithSum function**

FindPairWithSum(array, sum) iff there is a pair of elements that add up to sum. The same element can't be repeated, however there can be repeated elements.

* Write the function if array is assumed to be sorted from least to greatest. Give the big-o for time and space complexity.
* What if you can no longer assume the list is sorted? Write a new function. Give the big-o for time and space complexity.
